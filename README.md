### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

With over 4 years of experience as a data engineer and a PhD in Information Engineering, I am a passionate and skilled leader in designing and implementing efficient, scalable, and fault-tolerant data pipelines.

My expertise lies in building and managing data ingestion pipelines with technologies such as Spark, Airflow, Python, DataBricks, TrinoDB, and the related cloud architecture (mainly AWS) with CloudFormation and Terraform. I have worked with diverse datasets in different domains, including bioinformatics (proteomics), clinical/health informatics, and finance. I have a strong background in research and data science, which enables me to apply a rigorous and analytical approach to solving complex problems and delivering innovative solutions. I also have experience in backend development in Python and Java (Spring Boot), and the SOLID programming principles in general.

Throughout my career, I have led and contributed to various projects, both in industry and academia. These experiences have honed my skills in project management, stakeholder engagement, and collaboration with cross-functional teams. I am always seeking new opportunities to learn and grow, and I am committed to staying current with emerging technologies and best practices in the data engineering field. I am motivated by the challenge of transforming data into meaningful insights that can drive business value and social impact.
